Product Description 
*******************

The XCORE-VOICE Solution consists of example designs and a C-based SDK for the development of audio front-end applications to support far-field voice use cases on the xcore.ai family of chips (XU316). The XCORE-VOICE design is currently based on FreeRTOS, leveraging the flexibility of the xcore.ai platform and providing designers with a familiar environment to customize and develop products.

XCORE-VOICE example designs provide turn-key solutions to enable easier product development for smart home applications such as light switches, thermostats, and home appliances. xcore.aiâ€™s unique architecture providing powerful signal processing and accelerated AI capabilities combined with the XCORE-VOICE framework allows designers to incorporate keyword, event detection, or advanced local dictionary support to create a complete voice interface solution.

Key Features 
************

The XCORE-VOICE Solution takes advantage of the flexible software-defined xcore-ai architecture to support numerous far-field voice use cases through the available example designs and the ability to construct user-defined audio pipeline from the SW components and libraries in the C-based SDK. 

These include: 

**Voice Processing components**

- Two PDM microphone interfaces 
- Digital signal processing pipeline 
- Full duplex, stereo, Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) 
- Reference audio via I2S with automatic bulk delay insertion 
- Point noise suppression via interference canceller 
- Switchable stationary noise suppressor 
- Programmable Automatic Gain Control (AGC) 
- Flexible audio output routing and filtering 
- Independent audio paths for communications and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) 
- Support for Wanson Speech Recognition or chooser-0defined 3rd party ASR 

**Device Interface components**

- Full speed USB2.0 compliant device supporting USB Audio Class (UAC) 2.0 
- Flexible Peripheral Interfaces 
- Programmable digital general-purpose inputs and outputs 

**Example Designs utilising above components**

- Far-Field Voice Local Control 
- Far-Field Voice Assistance 

**Firmware Management**

- Boot from QSPI Flash 
- Default firmware image for power-on operation 
- Option to boot from a local host processor via SPI 
- Device Firmware Update (DFU) via USB or other transport

**Power Consumption**

- Typical power consumption 300-350mW 
- Low power modes down to 100mW
